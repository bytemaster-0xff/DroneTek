To support a very fast response rate and the potential of eventually putting a NETMF front end on top
of the app, almost everything in the app is IRQ driven in one way or another.

This document will show the IRQ priorities as well as expected maximum times per handler.

SysTick - 1ms calibrated IRQ

Primary control loop kicked off by timer
- Duration is 100uSeconds
- TIM7 -> IRQ Priority 2

- ADC Conversion Priority 8

Periperal Based IRQ's
- I2C Master
- SPI Slave
- USART - Telemetry (Min. 57.6K baud)
- USART - GPS (9600 baud)

EXTI Based IRQ Lines
- IRQ For Data Ready on Sensors
  - L3GD20
  - LSM303
  - BMP085
  - MPU6050
- IRQ For Sonar
- IRQ For reading PWM inputs
